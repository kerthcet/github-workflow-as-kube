## How To Use

To use the workflow, you have to:

- Provide a [OWNERS](./OWNERS) file, only the approvers have the privilege to tag `/approve` or `/approve cancel`
- Create a class `Personal Access Token` with one user (you can choose to use Fine-grained tokens as well), the user better to act as a robot in the repo, with the following permissions:
  - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
  - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflow files)
  - `write:packages` (Write access to packages)
  - `admin:org` (Full control of orgs and teams, read and write org projects, read org hooks, and read org custom properties)
  - `admin:repo_hook` (Full control of repository hooks)
  - `admin:org_hook` (Full control of organization hooks)
  - `notifications` (Read and write access to notifications)
  - `write:discussion` (Write access to discussions)
  - `project` (Read and write access to projects)
- Create a org-level [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) under `Security->Secrets and variables->Actions->Organization secrets`, it should be named of `AGENT_TOKEN`.
- Add the token owner, the robot to the repo's `Collaborators and teams` with `Write` role, under the `Direct access` section.
- Add the [init-workflow](./examples/kube-workflow-init.yaml) to your project under the path of `.github/workflows/`, then run the workflow manually, which will help you finish the setup, like creating necessary labels.
- Add the [workflow](./examples/kube-workflow.yaml) to your project under the path of `.github/workflows/`.

That's it, now you can use the commands to manage your PRs.

## Other workflows

We support other workflows as well, you can select as your needed:

- Golang ci workflow: running golang ci, golang tests. You should provide `make test`, `make test-integration`, `make test-e2e` primitives and do not edit the workflow name.

## Roadmap

- Dispatch reviewers
- PR review by AI agent.
- PR size detecting support
